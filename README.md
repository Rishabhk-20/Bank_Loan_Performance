Project Overview
This project undertakes a comprehensive analysis of bank loan data, leveraging SQL for robust data querying and manipulation. The analysis is complemented by advanced visualization and further exploration using Power BI, Excel, and Tableau. The primary objective is to extract actionable insights concerning loan applications, funding, repayments, and borrower demographics. The analysis spans various dimensions, including temporal (monthly trends, loan terms), geographical (state-level analysis), and categorical aspects (loan purposes, home ownership).
